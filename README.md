# Thesis_Deltares_Muddy_Coast_Suriname
Master thesis at Utrecht University, Climate Physics Master programe. 
Topic: Modelling waves and currents in muddy coastalareas, with a focus on the Suriname coastal zone.

Folder 'Harmonic Analysis': Results from simultions with Delft3D-FLOW, 
where harmonic analysis took place on water level and current velocity. 
Many thanks to Abdel Nnafie for helping out.

Folder 'Water Level': Analysis of water level data after harmonic analysis. 
Spatial maps of wter level elevation for the most signnifcant tidal constituents M2,M4S2,K1. 

Folder 'Current Velocities': Results after the harmonic analysis on current velocities. 
Plots of ebb-flood currents, tidal phase, and tidal ellipse with positive and negative phase and direction (dashed-dotted lines).
