Master thesis at Utrecht University, Climate Physics Master programe. 
Topic: Modelling waves and currents in muddy coastalareas, with a focus on the Suriname coastal zone.

Folder 'Harmonic Analysis': Results from simultions with Delft3D-FLOW  on the muddy coastal area of Suriname, 
where harmonic analysis took place on water level and current velocity. 
Many thanks to Abdel Nnafie for helping out.

Folder 'Water Level': Analysis of water level data after harmonic analysis. 
Spatial maps of wter level elevation for the most signnifcant tidal constituents M2,M4S2,K1. 

Folder 'Current Velocities': Results after the harmonic analysis on current velocities. 
Plots of ebb-flood currents, tidal phase, and tidal ellipse with positive and negative phase and direction (dashed-dotted lines). 

Folder SWAN-Mud: Inputs and results of simulations with SWAN-Mud 40.61
Subfolder 'SWAN-MUD setup': Setup of basic model using SWAN-Mud 40.61 (setup of larger scale models is not given due to the big size of large input data).
Subfolder 'Analyze raw data SWAN': Analysis of raw data from large scale simulations with SWAN-Mud on the muddy coastal area of Suriname.
